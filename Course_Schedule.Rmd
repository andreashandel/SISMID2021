This is the schedule for the course. From here, you can access all instructions and materials to help you prepare. 

**This schedule is subject to change, so check regularly for updates.**

## Notes

* SISMID was online last year and we recorded our lectures. Instead of repeating the same lectures from last year, we figured you will get more out of the course if you watch (some of) our lectures from last year on your own time in advance, and then in our Zoom meetings we will just be emphasizing some of the highlights of our lectures, followed by discussion and Q&A time. **This only works if you actually watch the lectures. If not, you'll likely feel lost. You have been warned `r emo::ji('grin')`.**


* **Time zones:** Seattle is in the PT zone. Your instructors are in ET (Andreas) and CT (Paul) zones. Some of you are likely in yet other locations and time zones. We hope we can keep things straight. For any times in this course **we will use PT/Seattle time as reference.** We also plan to be clear when posting any time by stating the time zone explicitly. If ever in doubt, i.e. if you see us posting a time without specifying the zone, please tell us to clarify. 

* For details on Slack and Zoom use, see the __Communication__ section.

* Abbreviations used: [DSAIRM = Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling - R package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/). 




## Before course start

* Familiarize yourself with this website. Read through all of it.
* Read our paper [Simulation Modelling for Immunologists](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2020-handel-natrevimm/).
* Set up the tools needed for this course, namely R, Rstudio and the DSAIRM package. Instructions on how to do that [can be found in the _Software Setup_ module of the SMI site](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse).



## Wednesday 2020-07-14, 11.30 - 2.30PT

**As preparation for today, and before we meet, do the following:**

* Watch the _Introduction to Innate Immunity_ and _Introduction to Adaptive Immunity_ lecture recordings, which you can [find here](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/Introduction_to_Immunology.html).

* Watch the _Introduction to Modeling_ and _Introduction to Simple Models_ lecture recordings, which you can [find here](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/Introduction_to_Modeling.html). You are welcome to read through the additional content provided in that module, but you don't have to.

## Any time

Go through any additional content on the [SMI website](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse/) that you are interested in. Feel free to ask us questions about any of those topcis, or anything else on Slack.

## After course end

* This course website will remain online. It will not be further updated.
* The [SMI website](https://andreashandel.github.io/SMIcourse) is continuously online and will receive future updates as we produce more content.
* DSAIRM and modelbuilder packages will continue to be available.
* We will keep the Slack workspace open for at least several more weeks (but might be slower to respond). Feel free to keep using it. I'll post a note to the Slack workspace before I shut it down. If you want to continue communications with us or fellow classmates after that, we suggest you switch to other means (e.g., email).
